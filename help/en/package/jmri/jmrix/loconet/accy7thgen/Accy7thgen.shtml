      <h1 id="general">Managing 7th-Generation Digitrax Accessory Decoder Addresses and 'Base Address'</h1>
    
      <p>JMRI can display the address usage of and may change the "Base Address" of Digitrax 
        "7th-generation" accessory decoders, such as the DS74, DS78V, PM74, and SE74 
        devices, using the "7th-Generation Accessory Base Address Change" tool.  
        <p>The tool also highlights 7th-generation Accessory devices' addresses 
        when they conflict with the address usage by other 7th-generation Accessory 
        devices.  Be aware that this tool <em>does not</em> identify any conflicts 
        with non-7th-generation Digitrax Accessory devices.  Users must carefully 
        check all of their address assignments to ensure that no two or more devices 
        use the same address(es)!
      
      <h2 id="viewing">Viewing All 7th-generation Accessory Addressing</h2>
      <p>By starting this tool, it automatically "discovers" all LocoNet-connected
          Digitrax 7th-generation Accessory devices.  Each discovered device is 
          shown on its own row, with the device type, serial number 'Base Address', 
          and lists of the addresses used by the device.
      <p>The "Find 7th-gen. Devices" button can be activated to recreate the list.  
          This can be useful if the set of devices on LocoNet has changed since the 
          tool was started.
      <p>This tool highlights any known conflicts between any two or more 7th-generation 
          accessory devices.  Any address group for an address type which conflicts 
          with another address group for <em>the same address type</em> is identified 
          by an address group with a <strong>red background</strong>.  This is 
          shown in the image below.

                 alt="An image of the 7th-generation 
                 Accessory Addressing Viewer and Base Address modifier showing Sensor 
                 Conflicts" >

      <p>Remember that LocoNet has different address "spaces" for the various types of addressing.  
          This means that, for example, a "Turnout" (switch) address numbered 10 
          cannot conflict with a "Sensor" address numbered 10, or a "Reporter" 
          (transponding) address numbered 10, or an signal "Aspect" address numbered 10, 
          or a "Power" address numbered 10.  Each "type" is in a different "address 
          space"!
          
      <p>Digitrax devices can produce "Power  Short-circuit" or "Power Auto-reverse" 
          information.  When it does so, it uses a single "Power" address for <em> four </em>
          power "sub-district" outputs for the PM74 device.  As such, all four of 
          the device are transmitted simultaneously in one LocoNet message at <em> one </em>
          Power" address.  This is significantly different from the other addressing 
          modes, where each reported piece of information corresponds to a single 
          address.

      <h2 id="baseChange">Changing 7th-generation Accessory 'Base Address'</h2>
      <p>To change a device's "Base Address", which changes the individual associated 
          addresses of the device, use the "Change Base Addr." button.  The tool then 
          opens a "dialog box" asking for the new "base address".  If the entered 
          "Base Address" is acceptable, the LocoNet message to change the device's 
          base address is sent.  The tool then removes ALL of the device entries 
          and re-scans the available Digitrax 7th-generation Accessory devices, and,
          if necessary, updates the highlighting of any "conflicting" addresses.

      <h3 id="Addressnuances">Notes on choosing a 'Base Address'</h3>
      <p>Most devices use the "Base Address" as the first of several "Turnout" 
          addresses.  But the PM74 "Base Address" is defined to be the "Power"
          address, with Sensors at about 8 times the "Base Address" and with 
          the "Reporter" address at about 4 times the "Base Address".  And the 
          PM74 will neglect to provide certain address types for large ranges of
          "Base Address" values - about the last 128 Base Address values of every 
          256 Base Addresses.  Perhaps this problem has been or will be solved in
          certain PM74 firmware releases.  Please check the Digitrax "updates" page 
          for further information.
      <p>The SE74 will use its addresses differently depending on whether the device 
          uses "SE8C-mode" signaling or "Aspect-mode" signaling.  When the SE74 
          uses "Aspect-mode" signaling, it uses FAR fewer turnout addresses.  That 
          makes "Aspect-mode" the preferred mode, in this author's opinion.  The 
          best solution is to modify the OpSw (or equivalent CV bit) for "Aspect-mode" 
          signaling.  That way this tool can get the signaling mode information
          and calculate the address correctly.
                    
      <h2 id="rosterentries">Updating Roster entries when changing a device's 'Base Address'</h2>    
      <p>Note that changing a device's "Base Address" will make its "Roster Entry",
          effectively, "unusable", if there was one created.  This is because the
          Roster Entry does allow the user to define the "Base Address" when the
          entry was created, but <em>does not</em> allow the "Base Address" to be 
          changed.
      <p>After changing the "Base Address", one should delete the appropriate 
          Roster Entry and create a new Roster Entry with the appropriate new "Base 
          Address".  (But make sure the new "Base Address" does not have any conflicts,
          either the ones that the 7th-generation Accessory device base address 
          management tool identifies, or any other devices!)
